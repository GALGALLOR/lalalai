Extract vocal, accompaniment and various instruments from any audio and video
High-quality stem splitting based on the world's #1 AI-powered technology.

### About
We are a team of specialists in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, mathematical optimization, and digital signal processing. **Our goal is to make working with audio and video easier** for musicians, sound producers, music engineers, video bloggers, streamers, transcribers, translators, journalists, and many other professionals and creatives.

In 2020, we developed a unique neural network called **Rocknet** using 20TB of training data to extract instrumentals and voice tracks from songs. In 2021, we created Cassiopeia, a next-generation solution superior to Rocknet that allowed improved splitting results with significantly fewer audio artifacts.

Starting as a 2-stem splitter, LALAL.AI has grown significantly during 2021. In addition to **vocal and instrumental**, the service was enhanced with the capability to extract musical instruments – **drums, bass, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, piano, and synthesizer**. As a result of this upgrade, LALAL.AI became the [world’s first 8-stem splitter](https://www.lalal.ai/blog/lalal-ai-adds-the-8th-stem-for-separation-synthesizer/). In the same year, we also presented [business solutions](https://www.lalal.ai/business-solutions/), enabling owners of sites, services and applications to integrate our stem-splitting technology into their environments via API.

Only available in English prior to 2021, LALAL.AI was translated into 7 other languages – Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. Furthermore, we added new payment methods to make LALAL.AI easier to acquire and more accessible to people worldwide.

In 2022, we created and released [Phoenix](https://www.lalal.ai/blog/phoenix-neural-network-vocal-separation/), a state-of-the-art audio source separation technology. In terms of stem-splitting accuracy, it surpassed not only our previous neural networks but also all other solutions on the market.

Although Phoenix exclusively handled vocal/instrumental isolation at first, its powerful technology allowed us to continually introduce new stems on a regular basis. Throughout the year we trained Phoenix to extract all musical instruments that Cassiopeia supported.

We also added two brand new stems, wind and string instruments, which no other service offered. With that update, LALAL.AI broke the record again and became the [world’s first 10-stem splitter](https://www.lalal.ai/blog/wind-string-instruments/).

LALAL.AI’s innovative technologies are used not only for stem splitting. In July of 2022, we introduced [Voice Cleaner](https://www.lalal.ai/blog/voice-cleaner/), a noise cancellation solution that removes background music, mic rumble, vocal plosives, and many other types of extraneous noises from video and audio recordings.

At the end of 2022, we created a [desktop version of LALAL.AI](https://www.lalal.ai/blog/lalalai-desktop-app/). The application enabled users to split audio and videos into stems in one convenient place on their Windows, macOS and Linux computers.

In the two years since LALAL.AI was created, the project has grown tremendously, as has our workforce. Since the Rocknet neural network launch in 2020, the LALAL.AI team has doubled in size. We work hard to create unique high-quality solutions and we always have a lot of ideas and developments in store. Keep your eyes peeled for new possibilities and improvements!
